## 01-html

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   i used only one outside resource, it was W3School.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   Very helpful, help me understand how a table works. I think understanding the colspan and rowspan was imporant. I also realized how indepth a form has to be. i did not realize i needed a field set for my radio buttons.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   Everything seemed straight foward to me

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   Yes, it was made more clear how to write basic html

## 02-ally

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   Yes, i was able to look back at my form for the 01-html

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   it was a good way to test how much i remember for the forms correctness and using the wave tool.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   Why is your `<br>` written like `<br />`, i feel this can be confusing at first. Is this just the same as having it be `<br>`?

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   Yes, i was able to experiement with the wave tool and understand accessibility a little better

## 03-css

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   i was able to do a few of them on my own, but i ended up using the videos for help.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   I found the position exercise very helpful. i think we can use the position absolute for navigation bars

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   i was really confused with selectors. at first i tried doing it myself and just made a class for each individual `<li>` and gave each one a specific text color, but then i watched the video. It was made more clear what we were supposed to do.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   Yes, i got a better understanding of using css, accessing by id, class, element, ect.

## 04-flexbox

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   I was able to finish Flex Container 1 and Flex Container 2, but i was not able to get the ones after that. So i used the videos for the rest.

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   Very helpful. I think everything here was helpful. This is a great way to format our html, such as centering, column/row spacing and repositioning the items.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   i think i would've liked to see more conent inside of each item, and see how that differs.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   Yes, i think this is a very simple, and easy, way to style group of elements together.

## 05-css-grid

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   i did not understand how to do it so i ended up using the video

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   This was super useful, and a great demonstration of how grids work. I the grid-template-area the most interesting.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   yes actually. i was wondering if we should stick to grids with no area. it seems like having a grid with an area can break the flow.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   Yes, I found the grid-template-areas portion to be the most helpful for understanding the area aspect. it was kinda confusing in the slides.

## 06-bootstrap

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   i ended up using the videos for this one

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   pretty helpful. Helped me understand the concept better

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   Well since there are thousands of styles that bootstrap offers, i feel like there are a couple that stand out. i guess something i wish could be explained is what are the primary classes we should be using

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   yes, all the exercises were helpful in their own way. I found the 04-modal exercise to be the most interesting.

## 07-javascript

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   well there are a couple i could've done my way, but when i ended up watching the video either way. It made more sense after watching the video

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   yes, both the 05-destructuring and 06-fetch exercises where very helpful for me.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   i feel like the index of an object was most confusing for me and i wish it could've been explained a little more. Like i want to see it as "object[i]" but in the case we had in exercise 03-object, it was like "object[key]" which to me seems kinda confusing. are we able to loop through it using a for-loop?

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   definitly the 06-fetch exercise. That one was very confusing and the exercise made it a little more easier to understand.

## 08-jquery

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

   i used the video for this one

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

   pretty helpful, but i feel like im still pretty confused about it.

3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

   i feel like this is working like bootstrap, instead of classes its functionality.

4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

   i feel like i needed to work on a very simple, and small, exercise to understand this better. Jumping straight into using this with fetch seems like a big gap. Helped me see the power of jquery, but im still left with questions.
